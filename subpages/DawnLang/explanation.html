    <h1>What is DawnLang?</h1>
    <p>DawnLang is a custom programming language developed solely by me, other than about ten lines contributed by another person. DawnLang is meant to be
        a new easy-to-learn programming language that is also a good high-level language that allows large-scale developments, sort of like Python. Python is
        reminiscent of BASIC in terms of the syntax for things such as for loops and while loops.
