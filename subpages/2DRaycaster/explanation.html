    <h1>What is raycasting?</h1>
    <p>Raycasting is a graphics drawing process commonly used in interactive graphical computer applications, AKA video games. While raycasting is relatively ancient now and
        not quiet in style anymore, its a tactic that was widespread during the 90's for video games. First, what actually is raycasting? Raycasting is the process of
        drawing a grid on a 2D surface, then drawing a player object then "shooting" out rays that represent the player's "vision", and then drawing these rays in 
        a different perspective to give a 3D effect. While this may sound complicated, this is relatively simple in theory and can actually be executed in about 
        300 or less lines of code. Three examples of video games that use this tactic are Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM and Duke Nukem. The reason this method is used for
        these games is because of its relatively light-weight hardware usage and great effect of giving the sense of true 3D. If any of the prior mentioned games 
        had attempted 3D graphics akin to what you'd see on an N64 or Playstation 1, then computers of the time would not be able to run it really at all, hence why
        they would use these graphical techniques for their games.
    </p>
    <h1>How does raycasting work?</h1>
    <p>It's a bit difficult to explain raycasting in words, its much easier to just show you how it works via the likes of playing video games, but it's quite simple
        in reality. Imagine a 2D graph, just an empty coordinate grid type of graph you'd see on a graphing calculator. Now lets imagine this graph as all 0's, each grid is
        just a 0. Now let's imagine the axes of this coordinate graph, lets represent these as 0's, so on our graph in the location where our axes would be, let's change those to
        1's. Our graph might look a little something like this now: <br> <br>
        0 0 0 1 0 0 0<br>
        0 0 0 1 0 0 0<br>
        0 0 0 1 0 0 0<br>
        1 1 1 1 1 1 1<br>
        0 0 0 1 0 0 0<br>
        0 0 0 1 0 0 0<br>
        0 0 0 1 0 0 0<br> <br>
        Now, lets imagine that these 1's are solid walls that cannot be passed, and these 0's are empty spaces that can be passed. Kind of almost seems like 
        the layout of a video game level now right? Well, your right! It is a layout of a videogame level! Our raycaster will take this array and draw a simple 
        grid on the screen like this, with a 0 being an empty space and a 1 being a filled space. Now, this next step may seem a bit abstract, but bear with me.
        Imagine this grid is actually a top down look at a 3D model of our level. Now, lets just imagine a person is down in the very top left zero of that grid
        and is staring straight into the corner at a 45 degree angle. Now let's take into account that person's vision and perspective, they can obviously only
        see so far in their peripheral vision. So lets just shade in this area that they can see and stop shading once we hit a wall boundary/1 in our grid. 
        Now you'll notice, that this makes a triangle! This triangle represents what our person can see, and these are our "rays" that we are casting. So now if we put it 
        all together, the raycaster will then take the 2D triangle image and how far away the walls/boundaries are and then draw a scene that is a projection
        of this triangle and the walls. There's more to raycasting in order to make it more like the old first-person shooter games of old like DOOM and Wolfenstein 3D, 
        but we'll get into that later.

    <h1>Why use raycasting?</h1>
    <p>While nowadays raycasting is an archaic form and in hindsight does have some flaws, it is certainly an interesting technique for its time that was spawned
        out of technical limitations. So, lets take a step back to 1992. You now have a giant CRT monitor, a Pentium 2 processor, a VooDoo Banshee GPU, 64 megabyes of RAM and about 8 gigabytes
        of storage on your computer, your plugged into the ethernet and you've got AOL browser open in the background. Some might say these were simple days, back when
        you would just put Super Mario World into your SNES and worry about nothing, but actually, these were far from simple days. All video games were pretty much
        made in straight assembly code and had to use genius tricks to even work and run, such as the NES sprite flickering, and raycasting was one of these tricks. Back
        in 1992 3D graphics were still not a common thing, huge billion dollar companies had access to this technology, but it was still a long way away from being
        commonplace with how low-spec computers and gaming consoles of the time were. Companies such as Nintendo were experimenting with 3D graphics at the time with games such
        as Starfox, but these were expensive to produce due to needing custom hardware in the cartridge and the development time was significant. So in came tricks, specifically 
        raycasting. Games were heading in the 3D direction, but nobody had the hardware for it, so somebody had to make some tricks that would work, which gave birth to
        raycasting, a sort of psuedo-3D or 2.5D as people like to call it. Due to raycasting just needing to run a few hundred calculations every second or so, this
        was perfect for the low-spec hardware of then, and then alas, raycasting became a thing. DOOM released in 1993 to critical acclaim and strong sales while using
        raycasting as its main graphical rendering (technically DOOM used an advanced method of raycasting known as binary space partitioning, but we'll get to that later,
        however what is considered the first true 3D game is in fact DOOM's predecessor, Wolfenstein 3D) DOOM was a huge hit, and because of this, raycasting spread.
        And it spread far. Very far. Soon games such as System Shock and Duke Nukem were using them and were able to run on relatively low-spec hardware for the time, thus 
        giving an appeal to raycasting for the time to most game developers. Nowadays raycasting is nowhere near as common as it used to be due to technology evolving quickly
        after raycasting spread, but now raycasting is useful for many reasons, such as building an old-school style FPS video game or for fun.
