    <h1>CHIP-8 Emulator</h1>
    <p>Over the last few weeks I have spent my time developing a CHIP-8 Emulator. The CHIP-8 is not necessarily a specific computer but an interpreted
        programming language/operating system that was used on several devices during the 1970s on home computers. My CHIP-8 Emulator is written in C and uses OpenGL
        for a graphics library and will likely use SDL in the future for as a sound library. While my emulator is far from perfect and is still being worked (try running
        Space Invaders for example, Just about 0 games work right so far, but games do technically "emulate") I have learned so much from this project in terms of how
        computers work on a lower level and more about how emulators work too. My code is a mess and in desperate need of refactoring but can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/Pyro569/CHIP-8-Emulator">here.</a> In the future I can most likely see myself making more emulators for systems such as the Gameboy
        or even the NES or also writing a guide on developing an emulator here on the website.
