    <p id="whatKobiWare">KobiWare Software Solutions is an industry-leading, bleeding-edge software development team by a group of four people. I happen to be
        one of these members, and what some might say is the one that pushes the furthest to increase our wingspan to have more varied software. KobiWare's 
        software lineup consists of such well-known classic apps such as: Feiler File Manager and KobiWare Engine. Feiler File Manager is a one of a kind 3D 
        file manager software and KobiWare Engine is a state of the art game-engine with support for C and C++. KobiWare also has developed many other types of
        software such as: Software Renderers, Video Games and Operating Systems. Below is a list of all KobiWare products and downloads. Most KobiWare releases have their 
        source code available at <a href="https://github.com/KobiWare">https://github.com/KobiWare</a>
