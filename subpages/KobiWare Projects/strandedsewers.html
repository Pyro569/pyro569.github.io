    <h1 id="overheadTitle">Stranded in the Sewers</h1>

    <p>Stranded in the Sewers is the first video game release from KobiWare Software Solutions, but don't let that put you off! Stranded in the Sewers is 
        actually KobiWare Software Solution's most played and highest rated video game project! Stranded in the Sewers is about how a 
        red cat and blue dog have fallen into the sewers of Chicago and its up to you to help them get out! Played using just the arrow keys and WASD, this 
        game is fun for two!
