<h1>Interpreted Programming Language</h1>
<p>Having recently created my own interpreted programming language I have decided to start my own tutorial series on creating an interpreted programming language!
    As I do not want to clog up the main landing page with tons of sections on how to create an interpreted programming language I have moved it to a second page 
    <a href="/subpages/blogs/series/interpreter/interpreted_language.html">here</a>
