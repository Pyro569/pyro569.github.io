    <h1>TSA</h1>
    <p>TSA is the Technology Student Association. You can imagine TSA as an engineering club but you compete against other nerdy high schoolers to win trophies or awards
        at competitions to show your dominance in your technology skills. My tenure in TSA so far is 3 years, starting in my freshman year of high school. I joined TSA
        relatively late into the TSA year (right before our state competition) and did the cybersecurity event and placed in the top three, thus going to TSA Nationals 2022 in Dallas, Texas.
        After that year my participation in TSA expanded massively, deciding to take on more events and projects. Below is a list to my projects I've made during my time in TSA
        and more information about them as well as links to the project if they are publicly available.
