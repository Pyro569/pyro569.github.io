<h1>Let's Build an Interpreter</h1>
<p>An interpreter is defined as a "program that directly executes the instructions in a high-level language without converting it into machine code." Simply put, an
    interpreter is kind of like a calculator, you enter instructions, for example your instructions might be "9 + 7 / 1 * 6" and then it "interprets" the instructions,
    it figures out what you want done based off of these instructions. However in this series, we will be building a simple interpreter that is in its infancy to become
    a fully grown interpreted programming language. Famous examples of interpreted programming languages include: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP.
