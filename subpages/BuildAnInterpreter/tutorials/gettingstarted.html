    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>Before we get started on making an interpreter, we must first understand how an interpreter works and what it is. To keep things relatively simple,
        an interpreter (in the world of programming) is a program that accepts an input and then tokenizes (tokenizes is an upcoming vocabulary word) it and converts
        said tokens and runs the correct code that should be ran for each token. An example of an interpreter is the Python interpreter. To print in Python you would
        use something along the lines of print("Hello, World!") which is interpreted and converted into C Code on the backend and ran as if that were C Code input 
        directly into the program.
    </p>
    <p>Moving onto a bit of the more technical side of how an interpreter works there are a few words we must understand. The most major term we must understand is 
        "tokenization". Tokenization is the breaking up of a file/input into small "tokens" in order to easily interpret what has been input. Generally in an interpreter
        each token is something that is considered an important component. For example, using the input of print("Hello, World!") the tokens would most likely be print, (
            , ", Hello, World, !, ", ) If you can understand what a token is, you will be able to understand most of this mini-series.

    <p>Disclaimer: Despite the incredibly fun and educational nature of this series, if you are a new programmer or do not know how to program at all/learning how, it 
        is highly recommended to either skip out on this one for now and come back later. In the future I plan to hopefully have a fundamentals of programming series on
        this website, so if that is up, maybe try taking a look at that ;)
