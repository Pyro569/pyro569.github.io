    <h1>Basics</h1>
    <p>Before we start to set up our interpreter in this page, we will need a few things before hand. First and foremost, we will need an Integrated Development Environment
        for our interpreter, my interpreter of choice is Visual Studio Code. Next we will need to choose a programming language to use for our interpreter, for this I
        will be using C#, but as long as you can understand the fundamentals or know how to convert C# to your preferred language, you should be fine.
    </p>
    <p>Now that we have the important basics, we can start. The first basic segment of building an interpreter is constant input. Simply always have the program loop
        back around and ask for an input. For now my code looks like this: 
        <iframe src="snippet1.html" width="500" height="100"></iframe>
    </p>
    <p>After you have done that, you will want a method called something along the lines of "Tokenize" that takes in a string that is the input that the user was prompted
        for and input. After you have the method created, you will want a for loop that will iterate through each character of the string input. Inside of this for loop you
        will want an if/else statement, with the if statement using several conditions to check if the current character of the input is not equal to several special characters
        (These will be characters that will necessitate a new token, so in my case I used ;()"=<!>) After you have created this if/else statement you will want a list 
        with a name such as Tokens, this list will store each token. In your if statement, if the current character passes the check you will want to add the current character 
        to a string, if not you will want to add the string that is the current token to your list that contains all tokens and then add the current character to the string again,
        then append the string to tokens again and set the string to be empty. For now my code looks like this:
        <iframe src="snippet2.html" width="500" height="100"></iframe>
    </p>
